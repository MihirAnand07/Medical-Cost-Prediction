# 🧠 Medical Cost Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts **individual medical insurance costs** using supervised machine learning algorithms based on features like **age, BMI, smoking habits, and region**.

It includes everything from:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical testing
- Visualization
- Predictive modeling with **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**
